### `requirements.txt`

### `setup.py`
The Python file which indicates that the installation module/package is most likely packed and distributed using Distutils, the Python Module distribution standard. 

There are many alternatives to a `setup.py` file such as the [setup.cfg](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/declarative_config.html) and the more recent [pyproject.toml](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/pyproject_config.html).
